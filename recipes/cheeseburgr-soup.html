    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The concept of this soup is fantastic, I just prefer not to use canned condensed soups. For my next go-around, I
        plan on adding 2.5# of chopped potatoes like I did this time, but gently blitz some of it using an immersion
        blender to release some of the potato starches as thickener, then add an extra cup or so of cheese and omit the
        canned soup to keep it all-natural. I ended up adding more mustard—the acidity makes it pop. Adding pickles,
        mustard, more cheese, and red onions as garnish really takes it over the top in terms of yumminess. My hubby
        says he could eat an oil tankard of it! LOL. Note that I did make this in my Instant Pot using the slow cooker
        function, but it ended up taking closer to 15 hours on low to achieve fully cooked potatoes. I'll probably use
        the medium or high temp next time to see if I can shave it down to 8 or less.</p>
